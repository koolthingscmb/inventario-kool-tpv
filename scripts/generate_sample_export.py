REMOVED: Legacy sample export script.

This file was kept as a placeholder but the legacy export logic has been removed
and will be replaced by `modulos.exportar_importar.exportar_service.ExportarService`.

If this module is accidentally imported, raise ImportError to surface the need
to rewire calls to the new service.
